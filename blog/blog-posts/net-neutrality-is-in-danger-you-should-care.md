Net neutrality is the idea that Internet service providers (ISPs) and
governments should treat all data on the Internet the same, not charging
anything depending on the content, treating all websites and services the same.

#### You can use it has much as you want, for anything you want.

Net Neutrality has made the internet a giant space of free speech and
innovation. It gives all individuals and companies the same opportunity to find
an audience to whom share their ideas.

### What If They Kill Net Neutrality?

At the moment, all your data goes through a single connection and you pay a
monthly fee.

But what if ISPs started to charge you depending on what you’re trying to access
and do with your connection?

**With the end of net neutrality ISPs would be able to block websites and charge
subscribers an additional fee to access them, or even charge directly to
websites to deliver their content to customers faster.**

> This means that small businesses that cannot afford to reach users at faster
> speeds would be relegated to the background, because no one wants a slow
website.

### The End is Near

In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) chairman, Tom Wheeler
**passed the Open Internet Order to benefit net neutrality**, after decades of
work to impose it.

> In the next weeks, the President of USA will choose a new chairman of the FCC
> that will be able to reverse all the orders made by previous commissioners.

It’s not obvious what is the opinion of Trump about this topic, but **based on
his tweet saying that net neutrality is just a way of attacking conservative
media, and the relationship of Trump with modern types of media**, we can almost
certainly say that he’s not very much in favor of it.

### The future of Open Internet is in danger.
