## Google’s SDK is here, and it has a word to say in Mobile App development.


At first sight, this may seem the name of some kind of butterfly, but it is
**Google’s new framework for building high-quality native apps** for iOS and
Android. If you’re a Mobile Developer, you should take a look at it as it’s
going to change the way native apps are developed.

## # Code once, run anywhere

With Flutter, you can code one time and run the same app for iOS and Android
devices, and it’ll automatically adapt to each operative system.

You’re probably thinking _“What if I want to have different stuff on each
device?”._ — You can! Flutter gives you the possibility to adapt the code and UI
of the app depending on which devices are being run.



    theme: new ThemeData(
    primaryColor:
        Theme.of(context).platform == Target.Platform.iOS 
        ? Colors.grey[100] 
        : Colors.blue
    )


The above code changes the theme color to grey if the device used is running iOS
and blue if it’s an Android device.



### The Usain Bolt Of Mobile App Development

Everything is fast when using Flutter, from code writing to compiling.

If you want to build an app as fast as possible without much complication you’ve
found your way.


## # UI Code

The simplicity remains in how you only need one language for the whole app.
Forget a huge load of files created when developing using Android Native.

> Flutter’s widget is written in Dart language. 
> So you have everything in the same file, without having to keep switching files to modify the UI and its functionality.

The downside is the **deeply nested code** that you’ll need to write and edit
when using Flutter.

Moreover, when I say deeply nested code,  _I really mean it_! Imagine all the
conditionals, transformations, iterations, state reading, event handlers and the
UI in the same functions.

_I know, right?_

This makes it **unusable when you start** working with it but gets easier as you
start using it.


## # Hot Reload

Besides that, Flutter has the fantastic **Hot Reload** feature that is a fast
Dart Compiler technology that allows you to load code changes into a running app
without losing its actual state. The changes are applied **instantly** in the
running app.



### It’s not just fun and games

Flutter Beta 2 was announced in April 2018, and there is no stable version yet.
Which means that there’ll be changes and improvements that may demand changes on
your code.

Yes, it’s true that Google’s support to Flutter is impressive but, despite
this fact, the amount of libraries available to be used with Flutter is still
low. It would be very time-consuming for the developers to build the necessary
libraries, which ultimately kills the primary purpose of Flutter.

However there’s more…

## # Dart…

To develop Flutter apps, you’ll need to learn Dart or hire a Dart developer.
It’s really not a hard thing to learn, and if you’re a developer you might like
to learn as many languages as possible, but maybe you’ll lose some time trying
to get used to it.



### Is it worth it?

Flutter is fun and fast to code a well-designed app. Still has much room to
improve to become a real opponent to Android Native.

For a reasonably modern framework, Flutter has progressed remarkably quick and,
surely it will have a word to say in the future for the Mobile App development.

_Is it ready to be applied to big scale apps?_ Likely not, but I’m expecting
after these things are fixed, **we can all enjoy Flutter!**

> Well, folks, that is all for now!
