If you’re a Mobile Developer, you should take a look at it as it’s\ngoing to change the way native apps are developed.</p>\n<h3>Code once, run anywhere</h3>\n<p>With Flutter, you can code one time and run the same app for iOS and Android\ndevices, and it’ll automatically adapt to each operative system.</p>\n<p>You’re probably thinking <em>“What if I want to have different stuff on each\ndevice?”.</em> — You can! Flutter gives you the possibility to adapt the code and UI\nof the app depending on which devices are being run.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-theme:\"> primaryColor:\n   Theme.of(context).platform == Target.Platform.iOS \n   ? Colors.grey[100] \n   : Colors.blue\n)```\n\nThe above code changes the theme color to grey if the device used is running iOS\nand blue if it’s an Android device.\n\n*****\n\n### The Usain Bolt Of Mobile App Development\n\nEverything is fast when using Flutter, from code writing to compiling.\n\nIf you want to build an app as fast as possible without much complication you’ve\nfound your way.\n\n#### UI Code\n\nThe simplicity remains in how you only need one language for the whole app.\nForget a huge load of files created when developing using Android Native.\n\n> Flutter’s widget is written in Dart language. Same file without having to keep\n> switching files to modify the UI with its functionality.\n\nThe downside is the **deeply nested code** that you’ll need to write and edit\nwhen using Flutter.\n\nMoreover, when I say deeply nested code,** I really mean it**! Imagine all the\nconditionals, transformations, iterations, state reading, event handlers and the\nUI in the same functions.\n\n*I know, right?*\n\nThis makes it **unusable when you start **working with it but gets easier as you\nstart using it.\n\n#### Hot Reload\n\nBesides that, Flutter has the fantastic **Hot Reload **feature that is a fast\nDart Compiler technology that allows you to load code changes into a running app\nwithout losing its actual state. The changes are applied **instantly** in the\nrunning app.\n\n*****\n\n### It’s not just fun and games\n\nFlutter Beta 2 was announced in April 2018, and there is no stable version yet.\nWhich means that there’ll be changes and improvements that may demand changes on\nyour code.\n\nYes, it’s true that Google’s support to Flutter is impressive but,&#x3C;br>  despite\nthis fact, the amount of libraries available to be used with Flutter is still\nlow. It would be very time-consuming for the developers to build the necessary\nlibraries, which ultimately kills the primary purpose of Flutter.\n\nHowever there’s more…\n\n&#x3C;span class=\"figcaption_hack\">(Gif by giphy.com)&#x3C;/span>\n\n#### Dart…\n\nTo develop Flutter apps, you’ll need to learn Dart or hire a Dart developer.\nIt’s really not a hard thing to learn, and if you’re a developer you might like\nto learn as many languages as possible, but maybe you’ll lose some time trying\nto get used to it.\n\n*****\n\n### Is it worth it?\n\nFlutter is fun and fast to code a well-designed app. Still has much room to\nimprove to become a real opponent to Android Native.\n\nFor a reasonably modern framework, Flutter has progressed remarkably quick and,\nsurely it will have a word to say in the future for the Mobile App development.\n\n*Is it ready to be applied to big scale apps? *Likely not, but I’m expecting\nafter these things are fixed, **we can all enjoy Flutter!**\n\n> Well, folks, that is all for now!
